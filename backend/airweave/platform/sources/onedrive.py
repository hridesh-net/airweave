"""OneDrive source implementation (read-only).

Retrieves data from a user's OneDrive or SharePoint document library, including:
 - Drives (OneDriveDriveEntity objects)
 - DriveItems (OneDriveDriveItemEntity objects) for each drive

This follows a hierarchical pattern (similar to Todoist or Asana):
    Drive
      └── DriveItem (folder)
          └── DriveItem (file/folder)
              └── ...

We fetch and yield these as entity schemas defined in entities/onedrive.py.
