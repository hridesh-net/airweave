# Contributing to Airweave

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Airweave! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Python 3.11+ (for backend development)
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend development)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (recommended for optimal development experience)

### Open Source Development Workflow

As this is an open source project, we follow the fork and pull request workflow:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/airweave.git
   cd airweave
   ```

3. Add the original repository as upstream
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave.git
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Make your changes and commit them
6. Push to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository

### Setup Development Environment

1. Setup pre-commit hooks
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Initial setup with Docker
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. For ongoing development, we recommend using VS Code with our provided launch configurations:
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Use the "Run and Debug" view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D)
   - Select "FastAPI" configuration to run the backend
   - Select "Debug React" for frontend development
   - Use "FastAPI + ARQ Worker" compound launch for full stack development

   These launch configurations are more efficient for development than repeatedly using `./start.sh`.

## Development Workflow

### Code Structure

Airweave is a monorepo with:
- `backend/`: Python FastAPI application
- `frontend/`: React/TypeScript application

### Coding Standards

- **Backend**: We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting Python code
- **Frontend**: We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and follow TypeScript best practices
- Pre-commit hooks will automatically check your code before committing

## Adding a Source Integration

Adding a new source integration to Airweave is straightforward, especially when using the Cursor AI agent. Airweave's architecture makes it easy to connect to new data sources with minimal configuration.

### Using Cursor AI and Local MCP for Source Integration

Adding a source with Cursor should be pretty easy. Follow these steps to automate 95% of the work:


1. **Read the documentation**
   - Review the [Airweave documentation on extending connectors](https://docs.airweave.ai/extending-connectors)
   - Examine existing source implementations like Slack (`backend/airweave/platform/sources/slack.py` and `backend/airweave/platform/entities/slack.py`)

2. **Add your API reference or OpenAPI spec to Cursor**
   - Find the API Reference of the source you'd like to integrate.
   - Go to Cursor Settings > Features > Docs > + Add New Doc
   - Add the API reference URL.

   If you have an OpenAPI spec instead, simply add it to the folder.

3. **Start Model Context Protocol Testing Server (Optional)**
   You can allow Cursor to immediately test connections and synchronizations with your source if you allow it. In order to do this, you must do the following steps:
   - Set `LOCAL_CURSOR_DEVELOPMENT=true` in `.env `
   - Run the MCP server `python .cursor/mcp/sync_test/server.py`
   - Navigate to Cursor Settings > MCP > Add New MCP Server
   - Give a name, like "Run Sync Test Server", choose "SSE" and put in `http://localhost:8002/sse` as URL.

   Visit [MCP README](https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave/blob/main/.cursor/mcp/sync_test/README.md) to read more info.

4. **Explain your integration plan to Cursor Agent**
   - Describe what you want your Cursor Agent to do.
   - Reference the newly added API reference or OpenAPI spec: `@your-docs` or `@your-openapi-spec`
   - Also reference our Cursor rules with `@source-integration-rules.mdc`

   Example: `Write the source integration for Microsoft Teams with (@microsoft-teams-docs) and @source-integration-rules.mdc`

5. **Let Cursor generate the integration code**
   - Cursor will help generate both the entity schemas and source connector code
   - Review and refine the generated code as needed

6. **Test your integration**
   - Use the MCP tools to test your connection and run a sync. Read the []

### Source Integration Structure

A complete source integration consists of:

1. **Entity Schemas** (`backend/airweave/platform/entities/your_service.py`)
   - Define the data structures for each entity type
   - Extend from base classes like `BaseEntity`, `ChunkEntity`, or `FileEntity`

2. **Source Connector** (`backend/airweave/platform/sources/your_service.py`)
   - Implement authentication and API communication
   - Create entity generators for each resource type
   - Handle pagination, error retries, and file processing if needed

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your fork is up to date with the upstream repository
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. Make your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass and linting checks pass
4. Submit a pull request to the main repository
5. Update the PR description with any relevant information
6. Respond to any feedback from maintainers

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format for clear, consistent history:
```
type(scope): short summary

Optional longer description
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example: `feat(sources): add support for Notion API`

## Testing

- **Backend**: Run `pytest` in the backend directory
- **Frontend**: Run `npm test` in the frontend directory
- Use the "Pytest Debug" launch configuration in VS Code for debugging tests

## Documentation

- Update documentation when changing functionality
- Document new features, APIs, and configuration options
