Airweave's connector system is designed to be extensible, allowing you to create custom source and destination connectors for your specific needs.


After you've cloned or forked the Airweave repository, you can extend the platform by adding your own to the repo. Airweave will automatically pick up your new sources and destinations.

<Note icon="fa-solid fa-lightbulb">
We are working on making this easier in the near future. The new Airweave CLI + connector SDK will allow you to add new sources and destinations without having to clone the repository.
</Note>

The general platform module structure is as follows:


```
backend/app/platform
    ├── sources/
    │   ├── slack.py
    │   └── ghibli.py # See example implementation below
    ├── entities/
    │   ├── slack.py
    │   └── ghibli.py # See example implementation below
    └── destinations/
        └── weaviate.py
        └── weaviate_native.py
        └── pinecone.py
        └── custom.py # See example implementation below
    ... # Other platform modules
```


## Source Connectors

Source connectors define how data is extracted from various sources and converted into entities for processing. 

[Here](https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave/blob/main/backend/app/platform/sources/slack.py) is an example of the Slack connector implementation.

<CodeBlock title="Slack source connector">
```python
@source("Slack", "slack", AuthType.oauth2)
class SlackSource(BaseSource):
    """Slack source implementation.

    This connector retrieves data from Slack such as Channels, Users, and Messages,
    then yields them as entities using their respective Slack entity schemas.
    """

    @classmethod
    async def create(cls, access_token: str) -> "SlackSource":
        """Create a new Slack source instance."""
        instance = cls()
        instance.access_token = access_token
        return instance
```
</CodeBlock>



### Creating a Source Connector
After you've cloned or forked the Airweave repository, you can create a new source connector by creating a new file in the [app/platform/sources](https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave/tree/main/backend/app/platform/sources) directory.

To get a 3rd party connector working, you need to implement the following:

- Source class that extends `BaseSource` and is decorated with `@source`.
- `generate_entities`: This method should yield Entity objects. These can be anything from a JSON object to a PDF document.
- `create`: This method should return a SourceConnector instance. 
- Accompanying `Entity` schemas. You can find the Slack example [here](https://github.com/airweave-ai/airweave/tree/main/backend/app/platform/entities/slack.py). This helps Airweave understand how to process the data, and standardize it across your syncs.

<Note icon="fa-solid fa-lightbulb">
If you're using OAuth2 and you would like Airweave to handle the OAuth2 flow for you, you need to implement the `create` so that it takes in an access token and add your integration to the `dev.integrations.yaml` file.  We're working on making this easier in the near future, for now we recommend [reaching out to us!](mailto:support@airweave.ai)
</Note>


Here's an example of a custom source connector implementation. In this example, we're fetching data from the Studio Ghibli API and yielding it as entities. These entities are then used to process into your destinations.

<CodeBlock title="Custom source connector implementation">
```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator
import httpx

from app.platform.entities._base import ChunkEntity
from app.platform.decorators import source
from app.platform.sources._base import BaseSource
from app.platform.auth.schemas import AuthType

@source("Studio Ghibli", "ghibli", AuthType.none)
class GhibliSource(BaseSource):
    """Studio Ghibli source implementation.
    
    This connector fetches film data from the Studio Ghibli API and yields it as entities.
    Each entity represents a Ghibli film with its details.
    """

    BASE_URL = "https://ghibli.rest/films"

    @classmethod
    async def create(cls) -> "GhibliSource":
        """Create a new Ghibli source instance."""
        return cls()

    async def generate_entities(self) -> AsyncGenerator[ChunkEntity, None]:
        """Generate entities from the Ghibli API.
        
        Each entity contains information about a Studio Ghibli film.
        """
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(self.BASE_URL)
            response.raise_for_status()
            films = response.json()

            for film in films:
                yield ChunkEntity(
                    source_name="ghibli",
                    entity_id=film["id"],
                    content=film["description"],
                    metadata={
                        "title": film["title"],
                        "original_title": film["original_title"],
                        "director": film["director"],
                        "release_date": film["release_date"],
                        "running_time": film["running_time"],
                        "rt_score": film["rt_score"]
                    }
                )
```
</CodeBlock>





### Source Connector Features

Your source connector can implement additional features:

```python
class CustomSourceConnector(SourceConnector):
    async def validate_config(self):
        """
        Validate the connector configuration
        """
        if not self.config.api_key:
            raise ValueError("API key is required")

    async def test_connection(self):
        """
        Test the connection to your data source
        """
        try:
            await self.fetch_data(limit=1)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to connect: {str(e)}")

    async def get_schema(self):
        """
        Return the schema of your data source
        """
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "content": {"type": "string"},
                "metadata": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "id": {"type": "string"},
                        "type": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```

## Destination Connectors

Destination connectors handle how processed entities are stored in your target system.

### Creating a Destination Connector

```python
from airweave.connectors import DestinationConnector
from airweave.types import Entity, DestinationConfig

class CustomDestinationConnector(DestinationConnector):
    def __init__(self, config: DestinationConfig):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.config = config

    async def store_entities(self, entities: list[Entity]):
        """
        Store entities in your destination system
        """
        # Your custom storage logic here
        for entity in entities:
            await self.store_entity(entity)

    async def store_entity(self, entity: Entity):
        """
        Store a single entity
        """
        # Example implementation
        pass
```

### Destination Connector Features

Implement additional features for your destination connector:

```python
class CustomDestinationConnector(DestinationConnector):
    async def initialize(self):
        """
        Initialize your destination system
        """
        # Example: Create necessary indexes
        pass

    async def cleanup(self):
        """
        Clean up resources
        """
        # Example: Close connections
        pass

    async def query(self, query: str, filter: dict = None):
        """
        Implement custom query logic
        """
        # Your custom query implementation
        pass
```



### Example Source Implementation

```python
# sources/api/rest.py
from airweave.connectors import SourceConnector
from airweave.types import Entity

class RestApiSource(SourceConnector):
    async def generate_entities(self):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(self.config.url) as response:
                data = await response.json()

                for item in data:
                    yield Entity(
                        content=item["content"],
                        metadata={
                            "source": "rest-api",
                            "id": item["id"]
                        }
                    )
```

## Destinations

The `destinations` directory contains implementations for different storage systems:

```
destinations/
├── vector_stores/
│   ├── weaviate.py
│   └── pinecone.py
├── search/
│   └── elasticsearch.py
└── custom/
    └── your_implementation.py
```

### Example Destination Implementation

```python
# destinations/vector_stores/custom_store.py
from airweave.connectors import DestinationConnector

class CustomVectorStore(DestinationConnector):
    async def store_entities(self, entities):
        vectors = await self.get_embeddings(entities)

        async with self.client as client:
            for entity, vector in zip(entities, vectors):
                await client.upsert(
                    vector=vector,
                    metadata=entity.metadata
                )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**

   - Implement robust error handling
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Use appropriate exception types

2. **Configuration**

   - Validate configuration early
   - Use type hints for configuration
   - Document required configuration

3. **Performance**

   - Implement batching where appropriate
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Consider rate limiting

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for your connector
   - Implement integration tests
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
